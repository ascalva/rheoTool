## About

[RheoTool] is an open-source toolbox based on [OpenFOAM�] to simulate Generalized Newtonian Fluids (GNF) and viscoelastic fluids under pressure-driven and/or electrically-driven flows.

The theory behind the single-phase flow solvers used in [RheoTool] can be found in [Pimenta F. and Alves M.A., 2017, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnnfm.2016.12.002) for pressure-driven flows, and in [Pimenta F. and Alves M.A., 2018, arXiv:1802.02843](http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02843) for electrically-driven flows.

The library containing the viscoelastic models has been developed based on the library used by _viscoelasticFluidFoam_ [(Favero et al., 2010, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech.)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnnfm.2010.08.010), already present in [foam-extend 4.0].


## Features

* all the features are available for 2D/3D problems and generic grids;
* the code is fully-parallelized;
* wide range of electrically-driven flow models;
* wide range of viscoelastic and GNF models;
* the log-conformation tensor approach is available for all viscoelastic models;
* the transient flow solvers (_rheoFoam_ and _rheoEFoam_) are highly stable regarding pressure-stress-velocity coupling;
* the material functions of any rheological model can be obtained numerically (_rheoTestFoam_);
* a set of tutorials is included to illustrate the application of the solvers to different problems;
* the theory and the tutorials are described in a user-guide;
* a solver for two-phase flows is available (_rheoInterFoam_), where any GNF or viscoelastic model can be used for each phase (_under-development_);
* the tool is available for both [OpenFOAM�] and [foam-extend] versions.

### Added Features
* the transient flow solver _rheoDyMFoam_ (essentially _rheoFoam_ with added dynamic mesh capability).
